/// has to map a handful of primitives onto its own rasterizer and then <see cref="Encode"/> the result
/// as a PNG. This is the seam the alternative render packages (Naiad.Skia, Naiad.ImageSharp) build on:
/// every pixel of the parse → CSS cascade → transform → flatten → marker → label pipeline is shared, and
/// only the primitive sink and the final encode differ between them.
/// <para>
/// Each call carries the current transform so the surface can apply it natively — keeping stroke widths
/// and text sizes correctly scaled — rather than having the walker bake it into the coordinates.
/// Coordinates are otherwise in local user space (X right, Y down).
